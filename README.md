📘 BookBridge - Book Exchange System for University

Inventory, Order, Finance, User & Support Management (MERN Stack)

📚 Project Overview

Book Bridge is a MERN Stack–based university book exchange platform designed to manage book inventory, borrowing, purchasing, and internal financial transactions within an academic environment. The system enables students and lecturers to exchange books using a secure virtual wallet, eliminating dependency on third-party banking services.

The platform includes User Management for secure registration, authentication, and role-based access control (students, lecturers, admins), and a Support System that allows users to raise tickets for inquiries, issues, or refund-related requests. Administrators can track, respond to, and resolve support tickets efficiently.

The project focuses on Inventory Management, Order Management, Finance Management, User Management, and Support Management modules, providing real-time stock updates, automated borrow/return handling, fine calculation, wallet-based payments, refunds, issue tracking, and comprehensive reporting for effective system administration.
